# QUERY REWRITING PROMPT
# Used to turn a follow-up question (e.g., "What about architecture?") 
# into a standalone question (e.g., "What is the architecture of transformers?")
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
query_rewrite_prompt: |
  You are a query rewriting tool.
  Rewrite the user question to be standalone based on the chat history.
  Your response should only include the rewritten question. Do not provide any further explanation.

    output: "What is the architecture of the Transformer model?"
  
  - input: "how does it compare to RNNs?"
    chat_history: "Explain the LSTM network."
    output: "How does the LSTM network compare to RNNs?"
